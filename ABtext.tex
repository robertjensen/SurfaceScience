In this part of the notes shall we consider the most abundant and used methods in surface science. It should be stressed that list of methods considered here is certainly not complete and mainly method of relevance for gas-solid interaction are treated. In many cases one or more bibliographies on a single method can be found, which should be consulted for more special or specific questions. The ambitions of these note has not been to give a detailed and exhausted review of the various methods but rather a brief overview so the student afterwards can read and orient himself in the literature.

In this part we shall focus on the physics and chemistry involved when gasses interacts with a solid surface. First shall the elementary steps in physisorption and chemisorption be treated and the methods used for these investigations. Later we shall focus on surface reactions and dynamics and finally see how this can be used to understand fundamental aspects of Heterogeneous catalysis.
